Walk is an Android app designed for one thing: supporting the kind of thinking that happens when you [go for a walk](/walking-and-thinking/).

No step counts. No fitness goals. No social features. No leaderboards. Walk provides gentle, non-looping audio and a minimal interface, then gets out of the way.

## What it does

When you start a walk, the screen goes dark. Audio fades in over eight seconds. You pocket your phone and walk.

The audio is generative — it doesn't loop or repeat. Each walk produces a unique soundscape that evolves slowly over time, providing the kind of "soft fascination" that neuroscience research associates with [default mode network](/default-mode-network/) activation. Gentle enough to fade into the background. Interesting enough that silence doesn't feel empty.

Walk includes five audio modules, each designed for different moods and preferences: layered oscillators, noise textures, dense ambient drones, near-silence, and natural sounds. All are generative — created in real time, never the same twice.

When a thought arrives — the kind of thought that [walks are famous for producing](/shower-thoughts/) — you can capture it with a voice memo without leaving your pocket. Tap, speak, done. No typing, no screens.

When you stop, Walk shows your duration and gives you access to your voice memos. That's it.

## The design philosophy

Walk is built on the principle of anti-engagement. Most apps succeed by maximising the time you spend looking at them. Walk succeeds when you forget it's there.

The screen goes dark because you should be looking at the world, not your phone. The audio is ambient because it should support your thinking, not demand your attention. There are no metrics because measuring walks turns them into exercise, and this isn't an exercise app.

Walk is a tool for [underthinking](/). You use it to create the conditions for creative incubation, then you put it away and let your mind do its work.

## The science behind it

Walk is grounded in research on [walking and creativity](/walking-and-thinking/) (Oppezzo & Schwartz, 2014), [default mode network activation](/default-mode-network/) (Raichle, 2001), attention restoration theory (Kaplan & Kaplan), and [the incubation effect](/problem-solving/) (Baird et al., 2012). See the [research page](/research/) for the full bibliography.
