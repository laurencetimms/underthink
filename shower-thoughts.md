question: "Why do your best ideas come in the shower?"
answer: "Shower thoughts happen because showering is a moderately engaging, low-demand activity that allows the brain's default mode network to activate. This network, discovered by Marcus Raichle in 2001, supports creative incubation, memory consolidation, and making unexpected connections between ideas. Research by Zachary Irving at the University of Virginia showed that moderately engaging tasks produce more creative ideas than either boredom or focused effort."

In a 2014 survey, cognitive psychologist Scott Barry Kaufman found that 72% of people have experienced creative ideas in the shower. Fourteen percent said they sometimes shower specifically to generate new ideas. If you've ever had a breakthrough while shampooing, you're in good company.

But it's not the shower itself. It's the mental state that showering creates.

## The three ingredients

Neuroscientists point to a specific combination of conditions that make the shower so effective for creative thinking.

**First, relaxation.** Warm water, enclosed space, no external demands. Your body shifts toward parasympathetic nervous system activation — the "rest and digest" mode. Anxiety drops. When anxiety drops, your brain's executive control loosens its grip, and associative thinking becomes easier.

**Second, low cognitive demand.** You've showered thousands of times. The task requires almost no conscious thought. This frees your brain to activate what neuroscientist Marcus Raichle identified in 2001 as the [default mode network](/default-mode-network/) — a system of brain regions that becomes active precisely when you're *not* focused on an external task. The DMN handles self-referential thought, memory consolidation, future planning, and — critically — making unexpected connections between ideas.

**Third, moderate engagement.** This is the part most people miss. In 2024, Zachary Irving and Caitlin Mills at the University of Virginia published research that refined our understanding of the "shower effect." They found that it's not enough to simply stop focusing. Doing *nothing* — lying in bed staring at the ceiling — doesn't produce the same creative benefits. What works is being *moderately engaged* in something: showering, walking, washing dishes. The light occupation of your task-positive network seems to create the conditions for the default mode network to work most productively.

As Irving put it: "Mind-wandering might help in some contexts, like taking a walk, but not others, like a dull psych task."

## It's not just showers

The shower gets the credit, but the same effect happens during many other activities. Walking the dog. Driving a familiar route. Gardening. Folding laundry. Knitting. Any well-practised activity that occupies your hands and a small portion of your attention without demanding real cognitive effort.

John Kounios, a cognitive neuroscientist at Drexel University, describes it this way: when you're in the shower, "you don't have a lot to do, you can't see much, and there's white noise. Your brain thinks in a more chaotic fashion. Your executive processes diminish and associative processes amp up. Ideas bounce around, and different thoughts can collide and connect."

This is why [walking](/walking-and-thinking/) has been the thinking person's tool for millennia. It's why [fidgeting](/fidgeting-and-focus/) helps some people concentrate. It's why [stepping away from a problem](/problem-solving/) is often the fastest route to solving it.

## What this means in practice

The shower effect isn't magic. It's a neurological process with well-understood conditions. Which means you can create those conditions deliberately:

Give yourself a problem to chew on — really engage with it first. Then step away to something moderately engaging. Don't fill the gap with your phone. Let your mind drift. The DMN needs real space to work, and scrolling social media doesn't provide it.

The [Walk](/walk/) and [Clear](/clear/) apps are designed to create exactly these conditions — Walk through contemplative movement and generative audio, Clear through calibrated hand-eye coordination that occupies just enough attention to let the rest of your mind roam.
