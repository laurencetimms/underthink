title: "Mindfulness and underthinking are not the same thing"
summary: "Mindfulness and underthinking are neurologically opposite states. Mindfulness suppresses the default mode network to bring attention to the present moment. Underthinking activates the DMN to enable creative incubation and problem-solving. Both are valuable — for different situations."

question: "What is the difference between mindfulness and mind wandering?"
answer: "Mindfulness and mind wandering are neurologically opposite states. Mindfulness meditation activates focused attention networks and suppresses the default mode network (DMN), bringing awareness to the present moment. Mind wandering activates the DMN and suppresses focused attention, allowing the brain to make associative connections, process problems unconsciously, and generate creative insights. Mindfulness is effective for reducing anxiety and rumination; mind wandering is effective for creative incubation and problem-solving."

Mindfulness meditation has become one of the most widely recommended mental practices of our time, and for good reason. Research has demonstrated genuine benefits for anxiety, stress, emotional regulation, and attentional control. Apps like Calm and Headspace have brought meditation to millions.

Underthinking — the deliberate practice of letting your mind wander — is something quite different. It's not a variation of mindfulness. In neurological terms, it's closer to the opposite.

Understanding the distinction matters, because reaching for the wrong one can mean spending time on a practice that doesn't address what you actually need.

## What mindfulness does

Mindfulness meditation trains you to direct attention to the present moment — typically to breath, body sensations, or immediate sensory experience. When your mind wanders, you notice the wandering and gently redirect attention back.

Neuroimaging research, including work by Taylor et al. (2013), has shown that experienced meditators exhibit *reduced* activity in the [default mode network](/default-mode-network/) during meditation. The DMN — the system responsible for mind-wandering, self-referential thought, and associative thinking — quiets down. Meanwhile, attentional control networks become more active.

This is precisely the point. Mindfulness is a practice of *not* letting the mind wander. It interrupts the DMN's default behaviour and replaces it with directed, present-moment awareness.

The benefits are real and well-documented. Mindfulness reduces rumination (the repetitive, negative self-focused thinking that characterises depression and anxiety). It improves attentional control. It helps people disengage from worry about the future and regret about the past. When your problem is an overactive DMN — when your mind won't stop racing, when you're trapped in loops of anxious or depressive thinking — mindfulness is a powerful intervention.

## What underthinking does

Underthinking is the opposite move. Instead of quieting the DMN, it activates it. Instead of directing attention to the present, it releases attention to wander freely.

When you go for a [walk without a podcast](/walking-and-thinking/), take a [shower](/shower-thoughts/), or occupy your hands with a [gentle task](/fidgeting-and-focus/), the DMN activates and begins its characteristic work: making connections across stored knowledge, processing unresolved problems, consolidating memories, simulating future scenarios.

This is the mode associated with creative incubation — the [Poincaré-on-the-bus moment](/problem-solving/), the idea that arrives while you're washing dishes, the solution that surfaces during a walk. The DMN needs space to run, and underthinking is the practice of providing that space.

## The wrong tool for the job

The confusion between mindfulness and underthinking matters because they address different problems, and applying the wrong one can be counterproductive.

**If your mind won't stop racing** — if you're anxious, ruminative, caught in loops of self-critical or worried thinking — mindfulness is probably what you need. The DMN is already overactive, driving repetitive, unhelpful patterns. Mindfulness suppresses that activity and redirects attention to something stable and present.

**If you're stuck on a problem** — if you've been grinding on something and can't see a way through, if you need a creative insight or a fresh perspective — underthinking is probably what you need. Your task-positive network has been working hard and hasn't found the answer. You need the DMN to take over and explore the problem from a wider angle. Sitting down to meditate at this point would suppress the very network you need.

**If you're burnt out or overstimulated** — if you've been staring at screens all day, jumping between tasks, never entering either deep focus or genuine rest — you might need either, or both in sequence. Mindfulness to settle the nervous system, then underthinking to process whatever has been accumulating in the background.

## Not a competition

This isn't an argument against mindfulness. Meditation is a genuine, evidence-based practice with profound benefits. The point is that it's one tool in a larger toolkit, and it's designed for specific situations.

Underthinking is another tool, designed for different situations. The skill is in recognising which one you need right now.

A useful heuristic: **Mindfulness says "be here." Underthinking says "go somewhere else."** Both are right — at different times and for different reasons.

If your mind is somewhere unhelpful and you need to bring it back, be mindful. If your mind is somewhere stuck and you need to set it free, underthink.

The two practices can even work together within the same day. A morning meditation to clear the noise and settle into the day. Then, when you hit a wall on a difficult problem, a walk or a session with [Clear](/clear/) to let the DMN work on it. The cycle of [focus and drift](/creative-cycles/) can include mindfulness as the reset between bouts of productive mind-wandering.
