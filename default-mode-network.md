question: "What is the default mode network?"
answer: "The default mode network (DMN) is a system of interconnected brain regions — including the medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and precuneus — that becomes active when a person is not focused on external tasks. Discovered by neurologist Marcus Raichle in 2001, the DMN supports self-referential thought, memory consolidation, future planning, social cognition, and creative connection-making. It is sometimes called the brain's 'resting state network' though it is actually highly active during rest."

In 2001, neurologist Marcus Raichle and his colleagues at Washington University in St. Louis made a surprising discovery. They were using PET scans to study brain activity during attention-demanding tasks, comparing it with activity during rest. They expected the resting brain to be relatively quiet. Instead, they found specific regions that were *more* active during rest than during focused work.

Raichle called this pattern "default mode" — the brain's baseline state when it's not engaged in a specific external task. The regions involved became known as the default mode network, and the discovery transformed our understanding of what the brain does when we're not consciously doing anything.

## What the DMN is

The default mode network is a set of interconnected brain regions that show coordinated activity during wakeful rest. The core regions include the medial prefrontal cortex (involved in self-referential thinking), the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus (involved in memory retrieval and self-reflection), and the inferior parietal lobule (involved in integrating information from different sources).

These regions are anatomically connected by white matter tracts and show highly synchronised activity. The DMN has been identified not only in humans but in other primates and mammals, suggesting it has deep evolutionary roots.

## What the DMN does

When the DMN activates, several important cognitive processes unfold.

**Self-referential thought.** The DMN is central to thinking about yourself — your identity, your values, your autobiographical memories. When you reflect on who you are and what matters to you, the DMN is active.

**Memory consolidation.** The DMN helps integrate new experiences with existing memories, sorting and filing information in ways that make it retrievable later. This is one reason sleep — when the DMN is active — is so important for learning.

**Future planning.** When you imagine future scenarios, plan ahead, or consider possible outcomes, the DMN is involved. It uses past experience to simulate possible futures.

**Social cognition.** Understanding other people's mental states — what they might be thinking or feeling — engages the DMN. This "theory of mind" capacity is fundamental to human social life.

**Creative connection-making.** Perhaps most relevant to underthinking: the DMN makes connections between ideas that seem unrelated. It draws on the full breadth of your stored knowledge and experience, finding patterns and links that focused, analytical thinking would miss. This is why [shower thoughts](/shower-thoughts/) and [walking insights](/walking-and-thinking/) tend to involve unexpected connections — the DMN has been quietly sorting and linking in the background.

## The seesaw

The DMN doesn't operate alone. It exists in a dynamic relationship with the task-positive network (TPN) — the brain system that activates during focused, goal-directed work. When one is active, the other tends to quiet down. When you concentrate on a spreadsheet, the TPN is active and the DMN is suppressed. When you stop concentrating and let your mind wander, the DMN activates and the TPN quiets.

This isn't a binary switch. Research by Roger Beaty and colleagues has shown that in highly creative individuals, the DMN and executive control network can cooperate — engaging simultaneously in ways that allow both idea generation and idea evaluation. This capacity for fluid switching between networks may be a key component of creative ability.

The [creative cycle](/creative-cycles/) — alternating between focused work and deliberate drift — is essentially the practice of rhythmically engaging and releasing these networks.

## DMN and mental health

The DMN's connection to self-referential thought means it has a complex relationship with mental health. In depression, the DMN can become hyperactive, driving ruminative loops — repetitive, self-focused negative thinking. In anxiety, the future-planning function of the DMN can become hijacked by worry. Research has linked DMN dysfunction to depression, anxiety, Alzheimer's disease, and schizophrenia.

This is one reason [mindfulness meditation suppresses DMN activity](/mindfulness-vs-underthinking/) — it interrupts ruminative loops by redirecting attention to the present moment. Mindfulness and underthinking address different problems: mindfulness quiets an overactive DMN; underthinking activates an underused one.

## The modern problem

The DMN needs space. It activates during gaps — moments when you're not focused on anything in particular. But modern life has eliminated most of those gaps. Smartphones fill every idle moment with stimulation. Social media, news feeds, podcasts, and messaging keep the task-positive network perpetually engaged.

The result is that many people rarely enter default mode during waking hours. The DMN's contributions to creativity, self-reflection, memory consolidation, and future planning are diminished — not because the network is broken, but because it never gets a chance to run.

Underthinking is the deliberate practice of creating those gaps. [Walking without a podcast](/walking-and-thinking/). [Stepping away from a problem](/problem-solving/). Doing the dishes without YouTube. Occupying your hands with a [gentle task](/fidgeting-and-focus/) while letting your mind roam.
