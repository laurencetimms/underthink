Underthink is grounded in peer-reviewed neuroscience and cognitive psychology research. This page collects the key studies and explains what they found.

## Default Mode Network

<div class="research-entry">
<p class="research-citation">Raichle, M. E., MacLeod, A. M., Snyder, A. Z., Powers, W. J., Gusnard, D. A., & Shulman, G. L. (2001). A default mode of brain function. <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>, 98(2), 676–682.</p>
<p class="research-summary">The foundational paper. Raichle and colleagues discovered that specific brain regions are more active during rest than during focused tasks, identifying what they called the "default mode" of brain function.</p>
</div>

<div class="research-entry">
<p class="research-citation">Raichle, M. E. (2015). The brain's default mode network. <em>Annual Review of Neuroscience</em>, 38, 433–447.</p>
<p class="research-summary">Raichle's comprehensive review of 14 years of DMN research, covering the network's anatomy, function, and role in self-referential thought, memory consolidation, and future planning.</p>
</div>

<div class="research-entry">
<p class="research-citation">Beaty, R. E., Kenett, Y. N., Christensen, A. P., et al. (2018). Robust prediction of individual creative ability from brain functional connectivity. <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>, 115(5), 1087–1092.</p>
<p class="research-summary">Highly creative individuals show greater connectivity between the default mode network and executive control network. Creative brains can engage both systems more fluidly, generating and evaluating ideas in closer succession.</p>
</div>

## Walking and Creativity

<div class="research-entry">
<p class="research-citation">Oppezzo, M., & Schwartz, D. L. (2014). Give your ideas some legs: The positive effect of walking on creative thinking. <em>Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition</em>, 40(4), 1142–1152.</p>
<p class="research-summary">Walking increased creative output by an average of 60% compared to sitting. The effect worked on treadmills facing blank walls, suggesting the physical act of walking — not the scenery — drives the benefit.</p>
</div>

## Incubation and Mind Wandering

<div class="research-entry">
<p class="research-citation">Baird, B., Smallwood, J., Mrazek, M. D., Kam, J. W. Y., Franklin, M. S., & Schooler, J. W. (2012). Inspired by distraction: Mind wandering facilitates creative incubation. <em>Psychological Science</em>, 23(10), 1117–1122.</p>
<p class="research-summary">Engaging in an undemanding task during a break improved creative problem-solving more than rest, demanding tasks, or no break. The benefit was associated with mind wandering, not with consciously thinking about the problems.</p>
</div>

<div class="research-entry">
<p class="research-citation">Irving, Z. C., & Mills, C. (2024). The shower effect: Mind wandering facilitates creative incubation during moderately engaging activities. <em>Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts</em>.</p>
<p class="research-summary">Moderately engaging activities (like showering or walking) produce more creative ideas than either boring tasks or focused effort. The activity needs to occupy light attention without suppressing mind wandering.</p>
</div>

<div class="research-entry">
<p class="research-citation">Dijksterhuis, A., & Nordgren, L. F. (2006). A theory of unconscious thought. <em>Perspectives on Psychological Science</em>, 1(2), 95–109.</p>
<p class="research-summary">For complex decisions involving many variables, people who were distracted after receiving information made better choices than those who deliberated consciously. The unconscious mind can weigh many factors simultaneously.</p>
</div>

<div class="research-entry">
<p class="research-citation">Wallas, G. (1926). <em>The Art of Thought</em>. London: Jonathan Cape.</p>
<p class="research-summary">The classic text that formalised the four stages of creative problem-solving: preparation, incubation, illumination, and verification. Anticipated what neuroscience has since confirmed about unconscious processing in creative work.</p>
</div>

<div class="research-entry">
<p class="research-citation">Christoff, K., Irving, Z. C., Fox, K. C. R., Spreng, R. N., & Andrews-Hanna, J. R. (2016). Mind-wandering as spontaneous thought: A dynamic framework. <em>Nature Reviews Neuroscience</em>, 17(11), 718–731.</p>
<p class="research-summary">A comprehensive framework for mind wandering as spontaneous thought, distinct from both focused attention and mindfulness. Argues that mind wandering serves important functions including creative thinking, future planning, and self-reflection.</p>
</div>

## Diffuse Thinking and Learning

<div class="research-entry">
<p class="research-citation">Oakley, B. (2014). <em>A Mind for Numbers: How to Excel at Math and Science</em>. New York: TarcherPerigee.</p>
<p class="research-summary">Barbara Oakley's framework for focused and diffuse thinking modes. Describes how the brain alternates between narrow, concentrated processing and broad, associative processing, and how effective learning requires deliberate switching between both.</p>
</div>

## ADHD, Stimulation, and Cognition

<div class="research-entry">
<p class="research-citation">Zentall, S. S. (2005). Theory of optimal stimulation. In S. Goldstein & R. B. Brooks (Eds.), <em>Handbook of Resilience in Children</em> (pp. 203–216).</p>
<p class="research-summary">Explains why people with ADHD often seek additional sensory input. The ADHD brain tends toward understimulation; self-generated sensory input (fidgeting, movement, background noise) raises arousal to the level where effective cognition becomes possible.</p>
</div>

## Attention Restoration

<div class="research-entry">
<p class="research-citation">Kaplan, S. (1995). The restorative benefits of nature: Toward an integrative framework. <em>Journal of Environmental Psychology</em>, 15(3), 169–182.</p>
<p class="research-summary">Attention Restoration Theory. Natural environments provide "soft fascination" — gentle sensory engagement that allows depleted attentional resources to recover, creating conditions associated with creative incubation.</p>
</div>

## Mindfulness and the DMN

<div class="research-entry">
<p class="research-citation">Taylor, V. A., Daneault, V., Grant, J., et al. (2013). Impact of meditation training on the default mode network during a restful state. <em>Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience</em>, 8(1), 4–14.</p>
<p class="research-summary">Experienced meditators showed reduced DMN activity during meditation. Mindfulness actively suppresses the default mode network — neurologically the opposite of the diffuse processing that supports creative incubation.</p>
