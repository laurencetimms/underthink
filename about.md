Underthink is an independent project. No venture capital. No advertising. No growth targets. Just a genuine interest in how thinking works, and a desire to share what the research says.

## The person

My name is Laurence. I'm a software developer and coach with over 25 years of experience building things. I currently work as a Squad & Service Coach at Genomics England, helping engineering teams improve how they work.

Outside of that, I build apps. [Walk](/walk/) started as a personal experiment — I wanted to understand why my best ideas came during walks, and whether I could create a tool that supported that experience without getting in the way. The research I found on the [default mode network](/default-mode-network/), [creative incubation](/problem-solving/), and [diffuse thinking](/diffuse-thinking/) explained what I'd been experiencing, and Walk became a way to apply that research practically.

[Clear](/clear/) came from the same curiosity applied to a different situation: what about when you can't walk? When you're at your desk, or on the sofa, or in a waiting room? People with ADHD have long known that [background tasks help them think](/fidgeting-and-focus/). Clear is a purpose-built tool for that.

Underthink is the home for both apps and the science behind them.

## The philosophy

Three principles run through everything here.

**Anti-engagement.** Most apps are designed to maximise the time you spend using them. Walk, Clear, and this website are designed to do the opposite. Walk succeeds when you pocket your phone. Clear succeeds when you forget about the screen. This site succeeds when you close the tab and go for a walk.

**Evidence-based.** Every claim on this site is grounded in published research. The [research page](/research/) lists the key papers with plain-language summaries. Where the science is nuanced or contested, we say so. We're not selling a miracle — we're sharing what cognitive neuroscience has found about how creative thinking works.

**Privacy-first.** This website doesn't use cookies, analytics, tracking pixels, or any form of visitor monitoring. Walk and Clear don't collect, store, or share any personal data. We don't know who you are and we don't want to. Your attention is yours.
