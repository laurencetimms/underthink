Clear is an Android app for people who think better when their hands are busy.

It creates a lightweight hand-eye coordination demand — soft blobs of light appear on a dark screen, and you interact with them. That's it. No score. No levels. No progression. Just enough gentle engagement to [quiet the noise and let clear thinking happen](/fidgeting-and-focus/).

## How it works

You choose a mode, set a timer (or don't), and tap Begin. The screen goes dark. Blobs of warm light begin to appear.

**Tap mode.** Blobs appear and glow softly. Tap them and they dissolve. Miss them and they fade on their own. No penalty either way.

**Flick mode.** Blobs appear and stay. Flick them in any direction and they roll off the edge of the screen with satisfying momentum. They accumulate gently if you leave them — a quiet backlog, not a pressure.

**Tilt mode.** Blobs appear in four colours. Each edge of the screen has a matching colour drain. Tilt your phone to roll blobs toward their matching drain. All blobs move at once, responding to gravity.

A demand dial on the edge of the screen lets you adjust the level of engagement: how fast blobs appear, how large they are, how many are on screen at once. Low demand is almost meditative — one large blob every few seconds. High demand requires sustained light attention. You find the level that works for you.

## Why it works

People with ADHD have long known that [playing a well-practised game can help them think more clearly](/fidgeting-and-focus/). The game occupies just enough of the brain's task-positive network to stabilise attention, freeing the [default mode network](/default-mode-network/) to do its work in the background — processing problems, making connections, finding clarity.

This isn't unique to ADHD. Research by Baird et al. (2012) showed that [engaging in an undemanding task during an incubation period](/problem-solving/) improved creative problem-solving for everyone. The key is calibration: enough engagement to prevent the mind from spiralling into anxiety or rumination, not so much that it becomes the focus.

Clear is a purpose-built tool for this. Where a game would add scores, levels, and rewards — pulling your attention toward the screen — Clear adds nothing. The blobs are gentle. The interactions are satisfying but understated. The experience is designed to fade into the background of your awareness while your mind does whatever it needs to do.

## The design philosophy

Clear is a sibling app to [Walk](/walk/). Both are built on the same anti-engagement principles: no gamification, no metrics, no social features, no analytics. Both are tools for [underthinking](/) — creating the conditions for the brain's default mode network to work.

Where Walk supports creative thinking through [movement and ambient audio](/walking-and-thinking/), Clear supports it through calibrated visual-motor engagement. Walk is for when you can go outside. Clear is for when you're at your desk, on the sofa, in a waiting room, or anywhere you need to think but can't walk.

Optional ambient audio (a generative drone soundscape ported from Walk) can accompany sessions for those who find it helpful.
