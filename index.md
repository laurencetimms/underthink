Everyone knows the feeling. You've been grinding on a problem for hours — and nothing. Then you step into the shower, go for a walk, or start doing the dishes, and the answer just *arrives*.

That's not a coincidence. It's your brain's default mode network — a system that activates when you stop focusing and start drifting. Neuroscientists have been studying it for over two decades, and the findings are clear: some of your most productive thinking happens when you're not trying to think at all.

We call it **underthinking**. Not carelessness. Not laziness. A deliberate, research-backed practice of giving your mind room to work.
